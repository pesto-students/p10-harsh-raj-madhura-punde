// Exercise4.1:Implement a function namedgetNumberwhich generatesa random number. 
// If randomNumberis divisible by 5 it will reject the promise else it will 
// resolve the promise. Letâ€™s also keep thepromise resolution/rejection 
// time as a variable.
// 1.JS promises should not be used.2.A custom promise function should be created.
// 3.This function should be able to handle all 
// 3 states Resolve, Reject and Fulfilled.
// 4.Should be able to accept callbacks as props.
// Guidelines:
// 1.JS promises should not be used.
// 2.3rd party libraries should not be used.
// 3.Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.
// 4.The program should execute without errors.
// 5.The program should achieve the desired result.
// 6.The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.

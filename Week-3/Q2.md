Create 3 simple functions where call, bind and apply are used. The intention of this exercise isto understand how they work and their differences.


1).call() accepts positional elements which are passed to the function.
It creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided values.

eg-
      function greet() {
        console.log(this.animal, "typically sleep between", this.sleepDuration);
      }
      
      const obj = {
        animal: "cats",
        sleepDuration: "12 and 16 hours",
      
      greet.call(obj);


2).bind() is similar to .call() but bind doesn't executes the function immediately.
It returns a function expression which can be called later. 

eg -
        const module = {
            x: 42,
            getX: function() {
              return this.x;
            }
        };
        
        const boundGetX = module.getX.bind(module)


3).apply() method calls a function with given this value and arguments provided as an array(array like object).

        1).apply() used in positional arguments eg-
                var a = [33, 44, 1, 77, 8]
                var max = Math.max.apply(null, a)
                Internally, Math.max(22,44,1,77,8)
                Without use of apply, the output will be undefined.


        2)const numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];
        const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);
        console.log(max);


With call, you have to know the arguments at compile time,
With apply, you can defer that decision at run time.

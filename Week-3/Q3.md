What is the output of the below problem and why

function createIncrement()
{ let count=0;
function increment()
{
count++;

        }
        let message=`Count is${count}`;

    function log()
    {
        console.log(message);
    }

    return[increment,log];

}

const[increment,log] =createIncrement();
increment();
increment();
increment();
log();// What is logged?

Answer:- "Count is 0"
Message is still pointing to old value of count.
Every time, increment is callled value of counter is initialised to zero.
The reference is lost here.
